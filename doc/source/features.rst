Features
******************************

Simplicity for the beginning, power when you need to expand.

- **Flexible pipelines:**  Use looper with any pipeline, any library, etc. You can also submit multiple pipelines per sample.

- **Flexible resources:**  Looper has an easy-to-use resource requesting scheme. With a few lines to define CPU, memory, clock time, or anything else, you can request different computational resources depending on the size of the input sample and pipeline to run. Or, just use a default if you don't want to mess with setup.

- **Flexible compute:**  With a simple config change, switch to process your pipelines from any cluster submission environment, to a local server, to your laptop. Switch back seamlessly.

- **Job completion monitoring:**  Looper is job-aware and will not submit new jobs for samples that are already running or finished.

- **Subprojects:** Subprojects make it easy to define two very similar projects without duplicating project metadata.

- **Collate input files:** Looper's *derived column* feature lets you easily use samples with input files on different filesystems or from different projects, with different naming convensions.
